    <h1>About Lab 2</h1>
    <p>In this lab, I developed a deeper understanding of how to structure a multi-page website by mastering the distinction between relative paths for internal navigation and absolute paths for external resources. I also learned to organize data effectively using HTML tables, focusing specifically on accessibility attributes—like the scope attribute in table headers—to ensure the information is interpretable by screen readers. By combining these structural elements with consistent Git version control, I’ve practiced how to build a web project that is both technically sound and user-friendly for a diverse audience.</p>
