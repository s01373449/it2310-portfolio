        <p>.Batman, created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, first appeared in DC Comics' Detective Comics #27 in May 1939. He is the alter ego of Bruce Wayne, a billionaire philanthropist and industrialist who, after witnessing the murder of his parents as a child, swore an oath to cleanse Gotham City of crime. Unlike many superheroes, Batman possesses no superhuman powers; instead, he relies on his intellect, peak physical conditioning, martial arts mastery, and high-tech weaponry, such as the Batmobile and his signature utility belt. Operating out of the Batcave, he is assisted by allies like his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, and the sidekick Robin, while often battling a colorful "rogue's gallery" of villains, most notably the Joker.</p>
